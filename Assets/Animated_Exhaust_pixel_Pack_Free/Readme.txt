Have fun with my hand animated rocket exhaust and I would kindly appreciate if you could share your game with me.

Thank you for downloading my asset pack! :D

all of the assets have exhaust states and are divided into three rows. 
top row = ignition 
middle row = main cycle
bottom row = shutoff 

animations played at 24 fps
